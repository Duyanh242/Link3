            <h2 class="title">What Sam Altman’s Firing Means for the Future of</br> OpenAl</h2>
            <p class="para">Sam Altman made OpenAI into a powerhouse by adding a profit-seeking arm to its utopian mission. After the board rejected</br> his vision, the company’s remaining leaders must figure out a new path forward.</p>

        <div class="center-mid">
            <div class="center-mid-left">
                <p class="paragraph">Sam Altman always insisted that he wasn’t the most important</br> person at OpenAI despite being its CEO. As he traveled the</br> world this year meeting world leaders—the world’s unofficial</br> ambassador of AI—Altman would soft-pedal his role, even as he</br> stole glances at his phone to keep up with what was happening </br>in OpenAI’s luxe San Francisco offices.</br> </br>

                    “We have an incredibly great team here that can do a lot of</br> things, so mostly, I defer to them,” he told me in May when I</br> asked him how the company ran in his absence. “But some</br> things only a CEO can do—some HR thing of the moment, or</br> you have to kill some project, or something with a major</br> partner.” Those items would accumulate on his phone and at</br> the end of the day he’d bat out responses. Then he would go</br> back to speechifying, meeting developers, and taking tea with</br> prime ministers.</br></br>
                    
                    On Friday, the mother of all “HR things of the moment” hit Sam</br> Altman like a Cybertruck. Around midday, according to OpenAI</br> cofounder and Altman ally Greg Brockman, the board of</br> directors of the nonprofit that governs the AI company suddenly</br> fired its CEO. A detail-free statement more worthy of a</br> company called ClosedAI said that the directors “concluded that</br> he was not consistently candid in his communications with the</br> board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.” An</br> internal memo to OpenAI staff, first reported by Axios, later said</br> the move wasn’t a “response to malfeasance” but offered little</br> further explanation.</br></br>
                    
                    It gradually leaked out that Altman’s exit was supported by chief</br> scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mura Murati, who became </br>interim CEO. Before Friday night was through, Brockman,</br> OpenAI’s president, had quit the company and reports came</br> that several other key employees were leaving, too.</br></br>
                    
                    With more shoes still to drop than a Nike clearance sale, it’s too </br>soon to know precisely what’s next for OpenAI. But already the </br>apparent boardroom coup stands with Apple’s 1985 dismissal of</br> Steve Jobs as the most shocking execution in Silicon Valley</br> history. From studying OpenAI closely this year for WIRED’s</br> October cover story, I can say some things about the impact of</br> Altman’s loss.</br></br>
                    
                    First, it’s important to remember that OpenAI was founded by</br> Altman and Elon Musk to fulfill a mission. “The organization is</br> trying to develop a human-positive AI. And because it’s a</br> nonprofit, it will be owned by the world,” Altman told me in</br> December 2015, just before the project was revealed to the</br> world.</br></br>
                    Though it seemed clear that Altman was the primary instigator,</br> he was not yet OpenAI’s leader. But the company was squarely</br> under his bailiwick: OpenAI was to be part of the research wing </br>of the startup incubator Y Combinator, where Altman was CEO.</br> Altman had started the division to chase the dream of using</br> tech to solve the world’s knottiest problems when he became</br> YC’s top executive. The original plan for OpenAI was to gather a</br> relatively low number of the world’s best AI scientists and</br> discover the keys to artificial general intelligence able to</br> outperform humans on every dimension, inside a structure that</br> gave ownership of this unimaginably powerful technology to</br> the people, not giant corporations.</br></br></p>
                    <!-- <span class="title-new">Rocky Start</span>
                    <p class="paragraph">OpenAI floundered in its early years, struggling to come up with</br> a scheme that made leaps, not baby steps, toward its goal. In</br> early 2018, Altman turned down Musk’s bid to take over the</br> company, and put himself in the hot seat as CEO, easing out of</br> Y Combinator to make the quest for AI the focus of his energies.</br> As he told me later, he realized that humanity had the chance to</br> create AGI only once, and he wanted in. Under his guidance, the</br> company transformed itself from a small research lab to the</br> world’s leading developer of the century’s most powerful</br> technology. After ChatGPT’s debut, Altman was the face of not</br> just OpenAI but the poster child for artificial intelligence’s</br> promise and potentially dangerous power. Inside Silicon Valley,</br> he was arguably the tech industry’s most admired leader.</br></br>

                        Can OpenAI maintain its track record of breakthroughs without</br> him? Altman is not a scientist, so it’s unsurprising that he did</br> not directly coauthor any of the company’s significant technical</br> achievements. But his dedication to the quest for AGI made him</br> a faithful servant and cheerleader of OpenAI’s machine-</br>learning mavens. When it comes to algorithms, the heart of the</br> company is Sutskever, an AI pioneer whose passion to create</br> AGI is just as strong as Altman’s. I saw the dynamic exemplified</br> when OpenAI gave me a preview of how its text generator GPT-3</br> could write code. Altman first outlined the significance of the</br> product, framing its place in the great journey toward general</br> intelligence, and then excused himself as Sutskever and his</br> technical team went through the demo and explained the magic</br> behind it.</br></br></p>
                        <p class="paragraph">Altman was more directly critical in addressing an existential</br> challenge for OpenAI when it became clear that systems like</br> GPT-3 could open a breakthrough new era in AI that we now</br> identify with ChatGPT. Training such large language models</br> would require billions of dollars and immense computing</br> infrastructure. Altman executed a pivot to an unusual corporate</br> structure where a for-profit corporation controlled by the</br> original nonprofit’s board took over the mission of building AGI.</br> He also struck a transformational $13 billion partnership with</br> Microsoft that gave OpenAI funding and access to its servers</br> and AI chips.</br></br>

                            These moves set OpenAI on a path that made it the</br> phenomenon that it became in the past year—but one that </br>apparently, for some insiders, looked like it was morphing into</br> the kind of corporate giant OpenAI was created to</br> counterweight. Altman’s departure this week potentially</br> imperils its relationship with Microsoft, whose CEO Satya </br>Nadella publicly bromanced Altman even as recently as</br> OpenAI’s developer conference last week. Though Microsoft</br> released a statement from Nadella reaffirming its support of</br> OpenAI on Friday, he has to be unhappy to see a project he has</br> bet billions and his own company’s future on in such turmoil.</br></p> -->
